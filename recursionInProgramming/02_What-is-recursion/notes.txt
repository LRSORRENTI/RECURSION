==================
What is recursion?
==================

Recursion is nothing more than 
a method that calls itself until a 
base case is reached. 

It's the case that when we hit a 
conditional, at some point, the 
recursion stops 

function recursion(num: Number){
    if(num === 10)
    // the above is our base case, if 
    // number is equal to 10, stop 
    {
        return;
    }
      return recursion(num + 1)
      // above is the recursive call, 
      // this is only reached if the 
      // base case is not returning yet
}
